# IDMEFv2 docker testing

This repository provides a set of `docker-compose` used for testing the components developed within the [IDMEFv2](https://github.com/IDMEFv2) organization. These components include:

- IDMEFv2 connectors for open-source cybersecurity probes and managers, source codes located in https://github.com/IDMEFv2/idmefv2-connectors
- [GLPI](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi) add-on for IDMEFv2 message enrichment, source code located in https://github.com/IDMEFv2/idmefv2-glpi-addon

## Overview

Each sub-directory provides a `docker-compose.yml` that defines a multi-container application.

Applications are modularized and use extensively the [**include**](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/include/) feature of `docker compose`.

Current application list:

| application        | description           | includes other application? |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| [clamav+connector](./clamav+connector) | ClamAV antivirus + IDMEFv2 connector  | testserver  |
| [glpi](./glpi) | [GLPI] asset management |   |
| [glpi+addon](./glpi+addon) | IDMEFv2 add-on for message enrichment  | glpi  |
| [suricata+connector](./suricata+connector) | Suricata NIDS + IDMEFv2 connector | testserver  |
| [testserver](./testserver) | a simple HTTP server to validate IDMEFv2 messages  |   |
| [wazuh-agent](./wazuh-agent) | [Wazuh] HIDS agent  |   |
| [wazuh+wazuh-agent+connector](./wazuh+wazuh-agent+connector) | [Wazuh] NIDS + IDMEFv2 connector | wazuh, wazuh-agent, testserver  |
| [zoneminder+connector](./zoneminder+connector) | [Zoneminder]  + IDMEFv2 connector | testserver  |
