## Additional information

A specific configuration file for `wazuh-agent` is provided in [./containers/wazuh-agent/files/ossec.conf](./containers/wazuh-agent/files/ossec.conf). This configuration file defines:
- Wazuh manager hostname and port
- a new entry for *File integrity monitoring*: this directory is located in `/test`

A shell script is provided in [`./containers/wazuh-agent/files/test-wazuh-connector.sh`](./containers/wazuh-agent/files/test-wazuh-connector.sh). This script generates Wazuh file integrity monitoring alerts by creating and modifying a file in `/test` (which is monitored by Wazuh agent according to the specific configuration file).
